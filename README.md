# Turbo Query

> Lightweight asynchronous data management

Turbo Query is a library created to manage asynchronous data on your code. This is generally used when you have to fetch data asynchronously for a given resource. Turbo Query allows you to manage this data by using an internal cache. It is very similar to how vercel's swr work. Turbo Query is also build to support arbitrary cache and event system, making it possible to create your own implementations.
